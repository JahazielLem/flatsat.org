## 🚀 Flatsat: The Hackable Spaceboard

**Flatsat** is a hardware based training platform designed to be vulnerable — on purpose. It's built for hackers, engineers, and space enthusiasts who want to dive deep into space-grade systems, learn cybersecurity concepts, and prototype their own payloads.

> Flatsat is part of the larger **[PwnSat Project](https://example.com/pwnsat)**, a complete space cybersecurity training course and mission-based CTF challenge where you’ll learn to attack, defend, and reverse engineer space firmware.

### 🧩 What You Can Do With Flatsat

- **Hands-on Learning** – Use Flatsat as the hardware companion to the **PwnSat course**, with structured lessons on binary exploitation, secure communication, reverse engineering, and space protocols.
- **Hack Real Vulnerabilities** – Explore and exploit firmware designed to simulate real-world satellite systems and vulnerabilities. It's a safe playground for learning and discovery.
- **Join the Mission CTF** – Participate in space-themed capture-the-flag challenges that simulate real satellite operation scenarios. Your board becomes your spacecraft!
- **Prototype Your Payloads** – Use the onboard components to develop and test your own payload logic, radio communication, or telemetry systems before launching bigger projects.


### 🧪 Onboard Components

- **ESP32-S3** – Powerful MCU with Wi-Fi and Bluetooth for comms and simulation.
- **SX1262 or RFM95** – LoRa radio for realistic space-ground communication scenarios.
- **MPU6050** – 6-axis IMU for sensor data emulation and tampering challenges.
- **BME280** – Environmental sensor for telemetry testing.


## 📡 Frequency Safety Notice

**Flatsat** uses **ISM (Industrial, Scientific, and Medical) band frequencies** for all RF communication — typically **433 MHz** or **915 MHz**, depending on your region. These frequencies are internationally reserved for unlicensed, experimental, and educational use.

We do **not** use sensitive or restricted space communication bands like:

- ❌ X-band  
- ❌ Ka-band  
- ❌ S-band  

This ensures that **Flatsat does not interfere with any production space systems, licensed satellites, or critical ground infrastructure.**

Flatsat is designed to help you learn and prototype radio systems safely and legally — all while gaining real-world skills in RF communication, signal analysis, and protocol fuzzing.

🔒 **Train like a pro, without breaking the rules.**

## Nothing it's done by itself LyndLabs make it possible
[LyndLabs](https://lyndlabs.io/) is the hardware design partner behind the Flatsat project, working closely with firmware developers to bring educational and hackable space-tech to life. While the firmware powers the logic, LyndLabs provides the robust physical foundation — from schematic design to PCB layout — making sure every component supports hands-on cybersecurity learning. Together, this collaboration fuses hardware precision with low-level software to create a truly immersive and functional training platform.
